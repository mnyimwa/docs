## [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/) 
---

Bootstrap is one of the most popular front-end frameworks that provided in the latest version some interesting updates:

- Dependency updates - jQuery and Popper.js replaced with pure Vanilla JS. One of the major reasons for dropping jQuery was to redefine the framework completely on modern JavaScript standards.
- Legacy Internet Explorer versions (10,11) are no longer supported. 
- Responsive Fonts - The viewport will dictate the size of the font.
